This paper examines the relationship between online neighborhood reputations and neighborhood demographic composition in Stockholm municipality in Sweden. I use topic modeling to measure the various dimensions of neighborhood reputations on Flashback (a Swedish online open forum). Results imply that ethnic composition in neighborhoods, residents' financial status and education attachments can also influence the online reputations of communities.

## Here are some interactive maps
