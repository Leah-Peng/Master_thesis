This paper examines the relationship between online neighborhood reputations and neighborhood demographic composition in Stockholm municipality in Sweden. I use topic modeling to measure the various dimensions of neighborhood reputations on Flashback (a Swedish online open forum). Results imply that ethnic composition in neighborhoods, residents' financial status and education attachments can also influence the online reputations of communities.

## Here are some interactive maps
### Maps for neighborhood demographics in Stockholm municipality 
- [The precentage of high economic standard residents in neighborhoods in Stockholm municipality]()
- [% low economic standard]()
- [% high eudcation attachment]()
- [% low education attachment]()
- [% of non-European residnets](https://sipet.se/wp-content/stkhmaps/stkh_nonEU_map.html)

### Maps for the probability of the neighborhood being linked to topics
- [Topic Crime]() 
- [Topic High status]()  
- [Topic housing queue]()  
- [Topic immigrant]()
